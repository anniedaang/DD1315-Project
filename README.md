Cheating and plagiarism (source: KTH)
If a student copies wordings or ideas straight off from a published source, without stating this, it is a case of plagiarism. The same applies if a student copies other people's ideas through summaries or paraphrases of someone else's text without stating this.


It is important that students "do their own work" when writing computer code, documenting experiments, creating a design or solving a mathematical problem. If they do not carry out these activities themselves, but still present the results as their own, then it is plagiarism.
Students who design new products draw inspiration from others' ideas and creativity, but the finished design must be created by the student himself. This means that the student must modify, develop or change the ideas that served as a source of inspiration, in order to make them something of their own.
